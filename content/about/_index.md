![Dallas Gutauckis (that's me!)](/dallas_620.jpg)

I'm a programmer by profession as well as by passion.

I am currently a Staff Android Engineer at [Instacart](https://instacart.com), focusing on improving mobile products, engineering processes, and helping people grow.

In my free time, I enjoy scuba diving, underwater photography, and biking.
