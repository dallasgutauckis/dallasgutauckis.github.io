![Dallas Gutauckis (that's me!)](/dallas_620.jpg)

Hi, I'm Dallas Gutauckis—a programmer by both profession and passion, currently working as a Staff Android Engineer at [Instacart](https://instacart.com). My focus is on building robust mobile products, improving engineering processes, and helping people grow.

### What I Love in Software

My primary expertise is in **Android development**, where I enjoy architecting modern, maintainable apps and mentoring teams. I'm passionate about:
- **Kotlin best practices** and writing clean, idiomatic code
- **UI/UX and animation**, making software visually engaging and delightful to use
- **Developer productivity and automation**—from scripting to building tools that make life easier for engineers
- **Open source**: contributing to and creating tools, plugins, and libraries for the community
- **Community involvement**: sharing knowledge through talks, blog posts, and user groups

I also enjoy exploring topics in cross-platform development, full-stack awareness, and general software engineering.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, you'll find me scuba diving, practicing underwater photography, or out biking.
