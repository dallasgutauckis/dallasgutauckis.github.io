Two nights ago, I posted about my costume, [Raptor Jesus](http://shinagle.com/2010/10/26/halloween-costume-raptor-jesus/). Since then, I've painted the full head and gone to work with the costume. I used the female ends of zip ties for teeth, which ended up looking pretty good for the costume. I'm glad I thought of that.

**At work, I won funniest costume!** With the prize ($100 gift card) I broke even on the cost of the costume. Pretty cool to be able to have fun for free. Pictures below.
