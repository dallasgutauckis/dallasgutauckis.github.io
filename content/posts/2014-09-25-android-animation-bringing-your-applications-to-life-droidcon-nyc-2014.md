Last weekend, I gave a talk on animation on Android at the innaugural Droidcon NYC (2014). The talk was well-received and I got some tough questions. Nonetheless, I'm happy I did it and I'm posting the presentation for your viewing pleasure. I highly recommend checking out the actual Keynote file (linked to from the Speakerdeck site) if you can as it includes the videos/animations as opposed to just static images.
