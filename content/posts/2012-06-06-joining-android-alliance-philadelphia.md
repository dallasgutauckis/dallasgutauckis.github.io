I was recently asked by [Corey Latislaw](http://coreylatislaw.com) to join her, [Chuck Greb](http://ecgreb.com), and [Arpit Mathur](http://arpitonline.com/) in helping organize the Android Alliance Philadelphia group. I am proud to announce that I have accepted the position as Social Media Director of Android Alliance Philadelphia and that I plan on helping to create an even more engaging community. I am excited to help bring in even more Android enthusiasts, creators, and users with interesting topics and informative events.
