title: "XSLTD Alpha: Almost There"
date: 2010-11-18
draft: false

The code is almost complete for the alpha version of XSLTD written in Scala. It's not the prettiest bit of code, but it's already accepting memcached protocol commands for XSL/XML storage and retrieval. I'm fighting with my HashMap right not to get the data in/out for those values, but it's coming along nicely. If I stick around again tonight and fight through it, I should have something ready to test and maybe even some stats up. Stay tuned...
