Last night, I gave a lightning talk alongside Matt Smollinger (a myYearbook iOS developer) and other local developers for [Philly Tech Week 2012](http://www.phillytechweek.com/). My talk centered around downloading, caching, and displaying images in an Android application. Check out [Drowning in Images -- Memory Management](/assets/2012/04/Drowning-in-Images-Memory-Management.pdf) or [all of my presentations](http://dallasgutauckis.com/presentations/ "Presentations"). You can also watch a video of my presentation [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk9-ndUIac). I have to thank [Android Alliance Philly](http://www.androidalliancephilly.com) and [Philly Cocoaheads](http://phillycocoa.org/)
