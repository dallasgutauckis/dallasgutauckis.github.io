[{"content":"I recently joined a new company to continue my career in Android development and leadership. Part of that is seeing how people code, what the team has found valuable in the past for best practices, and sprinkling some of my own ideas in as time goes on.\nI thought I\u0026rsquo;d share some of my thoughts here so that others can see these and consider them as well.\nKotlin Best Practices Only use destructuring on positional classes Destructuring can be a really clean way to unpack data, but it should be reserved for data types where the order of fields makes intuitive sense—namely, positional classes like Pair, Triple, or when splitting a string, e.g.\nval input = \u0026#34;userId=42\u0026#34; val (key, value) = input.split(\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;) When you destructure something like val (a, b, c) = someData, it\u0026rsquo;s no longer obvious what a, b, or c actually represent without jumping back to the class definition. This hurts readability and can lead to subtle bugs if fields are ever reordered or misunderstood.\nInstead, prefer using named accessors (someData.foo) unless destructuring truly enhances clarity and is immediately obvious from context.\nStructure state in a way that models the data available In modern Android architecture (especially with MVI), it\u0026rsquo;s critical to design your UI state in a way that matches what the user can actually see or experience at a given moment. This usually means using a sealed class to represent the different \u0026ldquo;modes\u0026rdquo; of the screen:\nsealed class UiState { object Loading : UiState() data class Error(val reason: String) : UiState() data class Success(val data: MyData) : UiState() } This approach helps prevent invalid combinations of state (like showing both a spinner and an error) and makes it clear in the UI layer how to render each state. Each subclass should fully represent a single, valid UI configuration.\nUse object/data object, not class… You\u0026rsquo;ll often see people reach for class when they really mean object, especially for singleton values. There\u0026rsquo;s a widely shared article that argues for using object on the basis of memory efficiency — but that\u0026rsquo;s largely a red herring.\nIn practice, the memory savings are negligible. The real value in using object or data object (as of Kotlin 1.9) is clarity of intent: if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry instance-specific data and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be instantiated multiple times, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a class.\nThis makes your code easier to reason about. Using object reduces boilerplate and makes exhaustive when statements cleaner and more reliable, since there\u0026rsquo;s no ambiguity around instantiation or equality.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about saving memory — it\u0026rsquo;s about making your code harder to misuse and easier to understand.\nKeep extension functions focused and contextual Extension functions are great for adding functionality to existing types, but they can become a dumping ground if not scoped appropriately. Prefer keeping them close to where they\u0026rsquo;re used (e.g. in the same file or module) and naming them in a way that reflects their context.\nGood:\nfun List\u0026lt;Event\u0026gt;.upcomingOnly(): List\u0026lt;Event\u0026gt; = filter { it.date \u0026gt; now } Bad:\nfun List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt;.filterValid(): List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt; { // Who knows what \u0026#34;valid\u0026#34; means here? return filterNotNull() } In this bad example, the extension is:\nToo generic (List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt;) Vaguely named (filterValid()) Unclear in behavior — the reader has to inspect the implementation to understand what \u0026ldquo;valid\u0026rdquo; actually means. Avoid vague, overly generic names like filterValid() or toCleaned(), especially if it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious what \u0026ldquo;valid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; means in that scope.\nAvoid nullable types unless truly necessary Kotlin gives you powerful tools to model nullability explicitly — use them thoughtfully. If a value should always exist, don\u0026rsquo;t make it nullable \u0026ldquo;just in case.\u0026rdquo;\nInstead of this:\nvar name: String? = null \u0026hellip;consider this:\nlateinit var name: String Or better yet, design your class so that name can be injected or passed in directly and be non-null from the start.\nMake nullability meaningful—not a default.\nAvoid else in exhaustive when statements When using when with enums, sealed classes, or sealed interfaces, avoid adding a catch-all else branch if you can enumerate all possible cases. Relying on else makes it much harder to find places in your code that need to be updated when new values are added to an enum, sealed class, or interface. Without else, the compiler will fail on unhandled cases, making your code safer and easier to maintain.\nFor example:\nwhen (state) { is UiState.Loading -\u0026gt; showLoading() is UiState.Error -\u0026gt; showError(state.reason) is UiState.Success -\u0026gt; showData(state.data) // don\u0026#39;t use `else` here so we can easily find cases we need to handle if we add a new UiState is UiState.Unauthenticated, is UiState.NetworkFailure -\u0026gt; showRetry() } If you add a new subclass to UiState, the compiler will alert you to update all relevant when statements. This helps prevent subtle bugs and ensures your code stays robust as your models evolve.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-06-13-thoughts-on-good-kotlin-practices/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently joined a new company to continue my career in Android development and leadership.

See https://twitter.com/cavega_/status/515566709927706624\nWhat I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand is why this is a 2nd-Gen-specific issue and not 1st-Gen.

The caller said they were just checking in on me to see if my issue was fixed or not. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, they gave me the number to contact their level 1 support (seems I\u0026rsquo;ve been downgraded). Obviously, nothing has changed, so nothing is resolved. Note that this call came in before the email response from Matt.\nUPDATE 5 [2014-10-07T19:30:00EST]: Our IT contractor happened to need to come in to set up network redundancy for our internet connection, at which time we also asked him to update the Cisco controller. The update seems to have fixed the PMF as suggested by Motorola support. Quick! Call your IT gang out to update your controllers. Best of luck to all.

One of the more common implementations is adding a border to something.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll explain by example:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;layer-list xmlns:android=\u0026#34;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;solid android:color=\u0026#34;#ccc\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item android:top=\u0026#34;1px\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;solid android:color=\u0026#34;#eee\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/layer-list\u0026gt; What this example shows is the layer-list way of going about the previous example. This will produce a drawable that has a 1px solid top border colored #ccc and a background of #eee. The confusing part to this for most people tends to be where the 1px is designated. layer-list draws top-down in the XML. This means that #ccc is drawn in the full background first, and then #eee is drawn over top of that, with a 1px top offset.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014-03-20-making-borders-for-views-using-layer-list/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAndroid is full of many ways to do things differently.

The problem with putting a ViewPager inside a ListView is that it takes only a small amount of vertical (Y) delta before the ListView begins to consume touch events instead of delegating to the child in order to enable the scrolling of the ListView. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, but the problem often occurs after the ViewPager has already started processing a page change (when dragging horizontally), producing a poor user experience resulting in the improper pagination and scrolling of the two views.\nThere are a few ways to try to handle this.\nYou could not do it at all (thanks Dianne and Mark) You can set a touch listener on the ListView and try to delegate the touches based on which view you think needs to get the touches and what actions need to occur based on those touches. You can also combine a touch listener with GestureDetector to try to make the implementation a little less cumbersome. The problem is that in some ListViews, our layouts are a little more complex than single item rows of text. If the item layout has for instance a Button, we\u0026rsquo;d then need to properly delegate the touch event down to the Button. This obviously has huge ramifications for implementation and testing. In order to avoid the aforementioned shenanigans, I added an OnPageChangeListener to the ViewPager and based on the state of the pager, forced a touch delegate from the Activity.\nContrived example:\nclass MyActivity extends Activity { private ViewPager mViewPager; private View mTouchTarget; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle icicle) { super.onCreate(icicle); setContentView(R.layout.example); mViewPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.view_pager); mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener(new OnPageChangeListener() { private int mPreviousState = ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE; @Override public void onPageSelected(int position) { // NO-OP } @Override public void onPageScrolled(int position, float positionOffset, int positionOffsetPixels) { // NO-OP } @Override public void onPageScrollStateChanged(int state) { // All of this is to inhibit any scrollable container from consuming our touch events as the user is changing pages if (mPreviousState == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE) { if (state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_DRAGGING) { mTouchTarget = mViewPager; } } else { if (state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE || state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_SETTLING) { mTouchTarget = null; } } mPreviousState = state; } }); } @Override public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) { if (mTouchTarget != null) { boolean wasProcessed = mTouchTarget.onTouchEvent(ev); if (!wasProcessed) { mTouchTarget = null; } return wasProcessed; } return super.dispatchTouchEvent(ev); } } Now, we have a ViewPager that retains control of touch events once the page starts changing and releases it when paging is idle or settling.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2013-04-30-android-putting-a-viewpager-inside-a-listview/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, I\u0026rsquo;ve been Googling for a while to find a clean, reasonable approach for putting a \u003ccode\u003eViewPager\u003c/code\u003e inside of a \u003ccode\u003eListView\u003c/code\u003e (or any vertically scrolling element).

Part of that is seeing how people code, what the team has found valuable in the past for best practices, and sprinkling some of my own ideas in as time goes on.\nI thought I\u0026rsquo;d share some of my thoughts here so that others can see these and consider them as well.\nKotlin Best Practices Only use destructuring on positional classes Destructuring can be a really clean way to unpack data, but it should be reserved for data types where the order of fields makes intuitive sense—namely, positional classes like Pair, Triple, or when splitting a string, e.g.\nval input = \u0026#34;userId=42\u0026#34; val (key, value) = input.split(\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;) When you destructure something like val (a, b, c) = someData, it\u0026rsquo;s no longer obvious what a, b, or c actually represent without jumping back to the class definition. This hurts readability and can lead to subtle bugs if fields are ever reordered or misunderstood.\nInstead, prefer using named accessors (someData.foo) unless destructuring truly enhances clarity and is immediately obvious from context.\nStructure state in a way that models the data available In modern Android architecture (especially with MVI), it\u0026rsquo;s critical to design your UI state in a way that matches what the user can actually see or experience at a given moment. This usually means using a sealed class to represent the different \u0026ldquo;modes\u0026rdquo; of the screen:\nsealed class UiState { object Loading : UiState() data class Error(val reason: String) : UiState() data class Success(val data: MyData) : UiState() } This approach helps prevent invalid combinations of state (like showing both a spinner and an error) and makes it clear in the UI layer how to render each state. Each subclass should fully represent a single, valid UI configuration.\nUse object/data object, not class… You\u0026rsquo;ll often see people reach for class when they really mean object, especially for singleton values. There\u0026rsquo;s a widely shared article that argues for using object on the basis of memory efficiency — but that\u0026rsquo;s largely a red herring.\nIn practice, the memory savings are negligible. The real value in using object or data object (as of Kotlin 1.9) is clarity of intent: if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry instance-specific data and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be instantiated multiple times, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a class.\nThis makes your code easier to reason about. Using object reduces boilerplate and makes exhaustive when statements cleaner and more reliable, since there\u0026rsquo;s no ambiguity around instantiation or equality.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about saving memory — it\u0026rsquo;s about making your code harder to misuse and easier to understand.\nKeep extension functions focused and contextual Extension functions are great for adding functionality to existing types, but they can become a dumping ground if not scoped appropriately. Prefer keeping them close to where they\u0026rsquo;re used (e.g. in the same file or module) and naming them in a way that reflects their context.\nGood:\nfun List\u0026lt;Event\u0026gt;.upcomingOnly(): List\u0026lt;Event\u0026gt; = filter { it.date \u0026gt; now } Bad:\nfun List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt;.filterValid(): List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt; { // Who knows what \u0026#34;valid\u0026#34; means here? return filterNotNull() } In this bad example, the extension is:\nToo generic (List\u0026lt;Any\u0026gt;) Vaguely named (filterValid()) Unclear in behavior — the reader has to inspect the implementation to understand what \u0026ldquo;valid\u0026rdquo; actually means. Avoid vague, overly generic names like filterValid() or toCleaned(), especially if it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious what \u0026ldquo;valid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; means in that scope.\nAvoid nullable types unless truly necessary Kotlin gives you powerful tools to model nullability explicitly — use them thoughtfully. If a value should always exist, don\u0026rsquo;t make it nullable \u0026ldquo;just in case.\u0026rdquo;\nInstead of this:\nvar name: String? = null \u0026hellip;consider this:\nlateinit var name: String Or better yet, design your class so that name can be injected or passed in directly and be non-null from the start.\nMake nullability meaningful—not a default.\nAvoid else in exhaustive when statements When using when with enums, sealed classes, or sealed interfaces, avoid adding a catch-all else branch if you can enumerate all possible cases. Relying on else makes it much harder to find places in your code that need to be updated when new values are added to an enum, sealed class, or interface. Without else, the compiler will fail on unhandled cases, making your code safer and easier to maintain.\nFor example:\nwhen (state) { is UiState.Loading -\u0026gt; showLoading() is UiState.Error -\u0026gt; showError(state.reason) is UiState.Success -\u0026gt; showData(state.data) // don\u0026#39;t use `else` here so we can easily find cases we need to handle if we add a new UiState is UiState.Unauthenticated, is UiState.NetworkFailure -\u0026gt; showRetry() } If you add a new subclass to UiState, the compiler will alert you to update all relevant when statements. This helps prevent subtle bugs and ensures your code stays robust as your models evolve.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-06-13-thoughts-on-good-kotlin-practices/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently joined a new company to continue my career in Android development and leadership.

During setup, I attempted to connect to our company\u0026rsquo;s Wi-Fi network to no avail. I was able to connect to another public Wi-Fi in the area but for some reason not to our typical Cisco WAP setup at work. All of the other devices we have at work are able to connect to the network, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what is going on.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve contacted Motorola customer support, supplied a logcat output of the Wi-Fi-related messages during the connection attempt, but they were not immediately able to resolve the issue. Instead, they\u0026rsquo;ve gathered my information and will be reaching out to me after escalating the issue internally.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll follow up more here as this issue and hopefully resolution progresses.\nUPDATE 1 [2014-09-26T14:30:00EST]: Motorola has called me back and are currently connecting me to their \u0026ldquo;level 2 support\u0026rdquo;.

So, I did. The conversation so far is as follows:\nMe to them\nFrom: Dallas Gutauckis \u0026lt;[redacted]\u0026gt;\nDate: Fri, Sep 26, 2014 at 11:37 PM\nSubject: Re: http://dallasgutauckis.com/2014/09/26/wi-fi-issues-on-moto-x-2nd-gen/#comments\nTo: supportforums@motorola.com\nHi,\nSomeone naming himself Matt commented on my blog post about the Wi-Fi issue some users are having with their 2nd Gen Moto X asking me to reach out. I already have an ongoing support issue ([redacted]) where I also already shared logcat output — not much but all I could give.\nLet me know if there is something else I can provide to get this matter resolved expediently.\nBest,\nDallas\nThem to me\nFrom: Motorola Support Forums \u0026lt;[redacted]\u0026gt;\nDate: Sat, Sep 27, 2014 at 10:00 AM\nSubject: Re: http://dallasgutauckis.com/2014/09/26/wi-fi-issues-on-moto-x-2nd-gen/#comments\nTo: Dallas Gutauckis \u0026lt;[redacted]\u0026gt;\nHi Dallas.\nHave you updated your router software? The Wifi team says old software versions of Cisco APs have problem with PMF supported devices. Cisco fixed this issue in later software versions.\nLet me know if that helps. Thanks.\nMatt Matt and Mark\nSocial Media - Customer Care\nMotorola Mobility\nVisit us at https://forums.motorola.com\nMe to them\nFrom: Dallas Gutauckis \u0026lt;[redacted]\u0026gt;\nDate: Sat, Sep 27, 2014 at 2:06 PM\nSubject: Re: http://dallasgutauckis.com/2014/09/26/wi-fi-issues-on-moto-x-2nd-gen/#comments\nTo: Motorola Support Forums \u0026lt;[redacted]\u0026gt;\nMatt,\nI\u0026rsquo;m unaware of whether the AP is up to date, and unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be able to simply try to update the routers because we don\u0026rsquo;t employ any full-time IT staff capable of managing the routers — this would instead require we pay a contractor to come in and ensure they\u0026rsquo;re up-to-date, something I\u0026rsquo;m not willing to do if we can\u0026rsquo;t be sure it\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nI know of other people having the issue — they might be able to check such a thing on their network. See https://twitter.com/cavega_/status/515566709927706624\nWhat I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand is why this is a 2nd-Gen-specific issue and not 1st-Gen. I realize they\u0026rsquo;re different devices, and potentially different networking hardware, but I would assume if it can work on one, it can work on the other.\nNot yet sure where this is going to get us…\nUPDATE 4 [~2014-09-27T9:00:00EST]: Got a call that went to voicemail (because I was still asleep). The caller said they were just checking in on me to see if my issue was fixed or not. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, they gave me the number to contact their level 1 support (seems I\u0026rsquo;ve been downgraded). Obviously, nothing has changed, so nothing is resolved. Note that this call came in before the email response from Matt.\nUPDATE 5 [2014-10-07T19:30:00EST]: Our IT contractor happened to need to come in to set up network redundancy for our internet connection, at which time we also asked him to update the Cisco controller. The update seems to have fixed the PMF as suggested by Motorola support. Quick! Call your IT gang out to update your controllers. Best of luck to all. Still a ridiculously shitty experience to have for a new device [where they know it\u0026rsquo;s going to be broken for users].\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014-09-26-wi-fi-issues-on-moto-x-2nd-gen/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI received my 2nd Gen Moto X today.

One of those things happens to be making a border for a View.\nThe common approach I\u0026rsquo;ve seen is for developers to have two Views. One View is the View with a background (be it solid, bitmap, or otherwise). The other View acts as a border, typically either 1px or 1dp in width or height, the other side matching the height or width of the other View. Although this is certainly an easy approach, at adds more to your layout than is likely necessary.\nExample with Views:\n\u0026lt;View android:layout_width=\u0026#34;match_parent\u0026#34; android:layout_height=\u0026#34;1px\u0026#34; android:background=\u0026#34;#ccc\u0026#34; /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;TextView android:layout_width=\u0026#34;match_parent\u0026#34; android:layout_height=\u0026#34;wrap_content\u0026#34; android:background=\u0026#34;#eee\u0026#34; android:text=\u0026#34;Hello, World\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Assuming those Views are encapsulated in a LinearLayout with vertical orientation, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with a TextView with background of #eee and top border of #ccc.\nNow, let me introduce you to layer-list…\nlayer-list allows you to do many things regarding multiple drawables. One of the more common implementations is adding a border to something.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll explain by example:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;layer-list xmlns:android=\u0026#34;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;solid android:color=\u0026#34;#ccc\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item android:top=\u0026#34;1px\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;solid android:color=\u0026#34;#eee\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/shape\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/item\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/layer-list\u0026gt; What this example shows is the layer-list way of going about the previous example. This will produce a drawable that has a 1px solid top border colored #ccc and a background of #eee. The confusing part to this for most people tends to be where the 1px is designated. layer-list draws top-down in the XML. This means that #ccc is drawn in the full background first, and then #eee is drawn over top of that, with a 1px top offset.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014-03-20-making-borders-for-views-using-layer-list/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAndroid is full of many ways to do things differently.

The problem with putting a ViewPager inside a ListView is that it takes only a small amount of vertical (Y) delta before the ListView begins to consume touch events instead of delegating to the child in order to enable the scrolling of the ListView. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, but the problem often occurs after the ViewPager has already started processing a page change (when dragging horizontally), producing a poor user experience resulting in the improper pagination and scrolling of the two views.\nThere are a few ways to try to handle this.\nYou could not do it at all (thanks Dianne and Mark) You can set a touch listener on the ListView and try to delegate the touches based on which view you think needs to get the touches and what actions need to occur based on those touches. You can also combine a touch listener with GestureDetector to try to make the implementation a little less cumbersome. The problem is that in some ListViews, our layouts are a little more complex than single item rows of text. If the item layout has for instance a Button, we\u0026rsquo;d then need to properly delegate the touch event down to the Button. This obviously has huge ramifications for implementation and testing. In order to avoid the aforementioned shenanigans, I added an OnPageChangeListener to the ViewPager and based on the state of the pager, forced a touch delegate from the Activity.\nContrived example:\nclass MyActivity extends Activity { private ViewPager mViewPager; private View mTouchTarget; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle icicle) { super.onCreate(icicle); setContentView(R.layout.example); mViewPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.view_pager); mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener(new OnPageChangeListener() { private int mPreviousState = ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE; @Override public void onPageSelected(int position) { // NO-OP } @Override public void onPageScrolled(int position, float positionOffset, int positionOffsetPixels) { // NO-OP } @Override public void onPageScrollStateChanged(int state) { // All of this is to inhibit any scrollable container from consuming our touch events as the user is changing pages if (mPreviousState == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE) { if (state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_DRAGGING) { mTouchTarget = mViewPager; } } else { if (state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE || state == ViewPager.SCROLL_STATE_SETTLING) { mTouchTarget = null; } } mPreviousState = state; } }); } @Override public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) { if (mTouchTarget != null) { boolean wasProcessed = mTouchTarget.onTouchEvent(ev); if (!wasProcessed) { mTouchTarget = null; } return wasProcessed; } return super.dispatchTouchEvent(ev); } } Now, we have a ViewPager that retains control of touch events once the page starts changing and releases it when paging is idle or settling.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2013-04-30-android-putting-a-viewpager-inside-a-listview/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, I\u0026rsquo;ve been Googling for a while to find a clean, reasonable approach for putting a \u003ccode\u003eViewPager\u003c/code\u003e inside of a \u003ccode\u003eListView\u003c/code\u003e (or any vertically scrolling element).
