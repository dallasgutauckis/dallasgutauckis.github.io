I've recently been thinking about how I could get into embedded electronics and came across a cool open-source project called [Arduino](http://arduino.cc).

> Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

That blurb pretty much sums it up. I've decided to commit some time and effort into this project, so I've set up a new desk and set of drawers in my bedroom specifically for breadboarding and Arduino programming. I've also purchased a kit and a book on Arduino from <a title="sparkfun.com" href="http://sparkfun.com">sparkfun.com</a>.</p>
