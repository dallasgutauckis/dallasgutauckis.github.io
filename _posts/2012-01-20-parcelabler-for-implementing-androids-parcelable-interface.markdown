  content: Great tool! One observation. You could generate the code for the unknown
    types too. You could assume they implement the Parcelable interface, and have
    the public static CREATOR member, and generete code for them as well. If there
    is any error, generating for those types too solves the problem. I did the above
    for my own parcelable tool. Though I don't have this cool interface like yours.

    a tool I wrote for creating Parcelable implementations for Android. At time of
    writing, I knew it wasn&#8217;t a great solution, but that at least it worked&#8230;

**[Update 2014-09-02]**: Since this original post, a plugin has been made for Android Studio/IntelliJ by Micha≈Ç Charmas with contributions from me as well. See [android-parcelable-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/mcharmas/android-parcelable-intellij-plugin) for installation instructions.

I have created a tool for making the methods needed for implementation of Android's [Parcelable](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html) interface within a pre-existing class.

0.  Open the [parcelabler tool](http://parcelabler.com).
0.  Copy the full code of the class into the "Code" text field.  
     Example code:  

     ```java
     public class Photo {  

        /**  

         * Caption for the photo  

         */  

        public String caption;  

        public int commentCount;  

        public long photoId;  

        public boolean isDefault;  

        public Bundle metadata;  

        public CommentHandler commentHandler;  

    }
    ```
0.  Click "Build" to create the methods
0.  Copy the methods into your class
0.  Add `implements Parcelable` to your class definition

Now you should hopefully have a working implementation of `Parcelable` in your class.
