At MeetMe, we have a yearly internal conference wherein we invite folks internal and external to speak to the team (en masse & in breakouts) about emerging technology, trends, core company bits, etc. My core focus this year has been about spicing up our Android applications through exceptional UI/UX specifically using the grace and beauty of animations. As they say, sharing is caring, and I want everyone else to have access... so please, take a look through my presentation. If you have feedback, questions, hate mail, or anything else -- please comment below.
