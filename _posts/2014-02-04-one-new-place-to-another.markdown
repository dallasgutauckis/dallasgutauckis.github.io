Over six-and-a-half years ago, I joined a small startup, MeetMe (then myYearbook), of around 20 or 30 employees in the small, artsy town of New Hope, PA. Over the years, MeetMe provided me with many opportunities to grow and learn, allowing me to transition from a full stack web engineer to an Android engineer. I truly am grateful not only for the opportunities that I've been given, but also for the team that I've gotten to work with.

But then, there is change. I've decided to make a transition and move on to new opportunities. I can't express how excited I am to transition to my new role as the lead Android engineer for SeatGeek, a search engine of sorts for finding great tickets to events -- be it sports, theater, music, or otherwise.

I'm excited for all of the new challenges I'll face working with the [SeatGeek](http://seatgeek.com) team, and I wish all of the best to the MeetMe team as they continue to help the world meet new and interesting people.
