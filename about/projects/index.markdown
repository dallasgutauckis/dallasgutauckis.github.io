### [XSLTD (Scala)](http://github.com/dallasgutauckis/xsltd)
 - **Opened**: Jan 2011
 - XSLTD's goal is to provide a daemon specifically for transforming XML via XSLT in a more rapid pace. In PHP, for example, we're left to deal with the overhead of loading an XSL document into memory on every page load, which is a large portion of the XSL transformation process. By retaining the parsed document in memory, we save a significant amount of time with only a minor trade-off of potential network overhead.

### [Lightr (PHP5)](http://github.com/myYearbook/lightr)
 - **Opened**: March 2008
 - This project isn't maintained any more but does contain code for interacting with BOSH servers and XMPP servers and is written in PHP5 Object-Oriented code.
