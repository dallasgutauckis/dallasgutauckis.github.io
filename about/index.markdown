![Dallas Gutauckis (that's me!)](/assets/dallas_620.jpg)

I'm a programmer by profession as well as by passion.

I am the Mobile Engineering Lead at [SeatGeek](https://seatgeek.com), mostly working to improve our products, engineering processes, and helping people grow.

As a matter of hobby I tend to enjoy photography, biking, and hockey.
